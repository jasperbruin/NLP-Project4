The program, among other things, referred to the claim that two soldiers of “Berkut”, who refused to kneel in front of Lviv Maydan and recognize the current government, allegedly were burned alive. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUDH0Qbjuao This was reported by the head of the so-called Russian community of Dnepropetrovsk Victor Trukhov. He says, two “Berkut” solders were put on their knees publicly and then burned in Lviv. However, contrary to this claim, a fire occured in Lviv on February 20, 2014 where people from security forces were caught in a fire. The fire started after a powerful explosion in the security forces basis, after which one officer in uniform and one in civilian clothes were pulled from the rubble. Commandos from “Berkut” kneeled on 24 February. Lviv citizens who came to the Maydan, were shouting “Shame!” and throwing small objects at security forces. To prevent any possible violence against “Berkut” soldiers, Self-Defense soldiers surrounded “Berkut”, and the priest was calming down people. \\xa0 People made the security forces to kneel on stage, and then one of the special forces soldier promised that “Berkut” will always be on the side of the people and assured that Lviv “Berkut” was not involved in the fighting in Kyiv. After the “ceremony” the commandos were taken away in the tram. Accordingly, the fire was the result of an accident and not the result of public humiliation of “Berkut”.',\n"," 'taxonomy_label': 'statistical',\n"," 'label_original': 'FAKE'}"]},"execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["train_data[-1]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2580,"status":"ok","timestamp":1716718048669,"user":{"displayName":"Jasper Bruin","userId":"13767118553284273610"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"HD0NZfDFkvW1","outputId":"dfaf453f-f96f-4be0-d628-a89962fcdcfa"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["3084"]},"execution_count":7,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["import json\n","with open(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/TUDelft/NLP Group Project/data/val_claims_quantemp.json\") as f:\n","  val_data = json.load(f)\n","len(val_data)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3,"status":"ok","timestamp":1716718048669,"user":{"displayName":"Jasper Bruin","userId":"13767118553284273610"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"ZT-q3h48kxdg","outputId":"65d5cd40-1945-4ee8-dc5f-300b1a660ca8"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["{'crawled_date': '2022-10-06T21:00:06',\n"," 'country_of_origin': 'usa',\n"," 'label': 'True',\n"," 'url': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/oct/28/randy-feenstra/biden-administration-predicted-liquid-fuel-cars-ou/',\n"," 'lang': 'en',\n"," 'claim': 'The Biden administration \"published a study concluding 4 (of) 5 new cars on the road by 2050 will still require liquid fuels.\"',\n"," 'doc': 'President Joe Biden was in Michigan’s auto industry hub on Oct. 5 when he said, \"the whole world knows that the future of the auto industry is electric.\" Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, had a quick response, writing on Twitter: \".@POTUS no it’s not — in fact, your own administration published a study concluding 4/5 new cars on the road by 2050 will still require liquid fuels ... \"It’s past time Biden lives up to his promise to expand clean-burning #biofuels. Don’t mess with the RFS!\" Feenstra is correct about the share of cars in the United States projected to use liquid fuels. The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s 2021 Annual Energy Outlook report, which projects the nation’s environmental plans through 2050, says about 79% of new vehicle sales will be powered by liquid fuels — gasoline and blends that include up to 85% ethanol — in 2050. They accounted for 95% of sales in 2020, the report states. PolitiFact contacted Feenstra’s communications staff over 10 times for comment but did not receive a response. However, Feenstra’s tweet shared the link to his sourcing, and on page 15, the federal report notes that, while electric energy’s biggest demand growth area is transportation, the share will be small — less than 3%: \"Current laws and regulations are not projected to induce much market growth, despite continuing improvements in electric vehicles (EVs) through evolutionary market developments. Both vehicle sales and utilization (miles driven) would need to increase substantially for EVs to raise electric power demand growth rates by more than a fraction of a percentage point per year.\" And, on the report’s page 26: \"Because most light-duty vehicles have internal combustion engines, motor gasoline remains the major transportation fuel through 2050 as personal travel returns to pre-pandemic per-driver levels in the longer term.\" While 2050 is 29 years down the road, Biden did not state in Michigan a time limit on when he thinks electric power would come close to liquid fuels’ share of the automobile market. Nor did he state in detail what that future for electric power for automobiles would be. His administration’s Annual Energy Outlook reports that it is not predicting future energy use; rather it is a projection based on assumptions and methodologies that can be changed when subjected to changes in technology, demographics and resources. The report also notes that it is a response to the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977. That law requires the U.S. Energy Information Administration to produce annual reports on trends and projections for energy use and supply, the report notes. But Feenstra was precise with his facts, and is not alone reminding Biden to support biofuels. Other Iowa congressional members, Republican and Democrat, have pushed for biofuels support, regardless of who is president. So has the biofuels industry. The reason? Iowa leads the nation when it comes to producing biofuels from farm crops. It has capacity to produce 4.6 billion gallons, double the 2.3 billion in the No. 2 state, Nebraska. While we focused this story on predicted biofuels use in vehicles, it’s worth noting that Biden promised support for biofuels in a Sept. 9, 2020, campaign statement that criticized a pre-election policy reversal by then-President Donald Trump on biofuels. Trump’s reversal led to his administration’s rejection of oil refinery industry requests to be exempt from requirements to blend certain amounts of ethanol and biodiesel in gasoline: \"A Biden-Harris Administration will fight for family farmers and revitalize rural economies — from keeping our promises to farmers by ushering in a new era of biofuels, to investing in the broadband infrastructure and rural health care access that families and communities need,\" the Biden statement read. Trump reversed course again and approved on Jan. 19, 2021, just before leaving office, three biofuel waivers for refineries. Feenstra said the Biden Administration predicts that four out of five new cars on the road will require liquid fuels in 2050 and he cites the source. That source, a report from the Biden Administration, states that 79% of vehicles on the road will require liquid fuels by 2050. We rate Feenstra’s statement to be True.',\n"," 'taxonomy_label': 'statistical',\n"," 'label_original': 'true'}"]},"execution_count":8,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["val_data[-1]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"E3Nv7MWSa9XY"},"source":["## Feature processing"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"7cYv6F4Nk4SJ"},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n","LE = LabelEncoder()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"8eKFjiC3i8Yx"},"outputs":[],"source":["def get_features(data):\n","  features = []\n","  evidences = []\n","\n","  for index, fact in enumerate(data):\n","    claim = fact[\"claim\"]\n","    # evidence = fact[\"doc\"]\n","\n","\n","    feature = \"[Claim]:\"+claim+\"[Evidences]:\"+fact[\"doc\"]\n","    features.append(feature)\n","  return features\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"qY7Gux6Yn5rI"},"outputs":[],"source":["train_features = get_features(train_data)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":203,"status":"ok","timestamp":1716718051238,"user":{"displayName":"Jasper Bruin","userId":"13767118553284273610"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"VJ5AoF54oV2t","outputId":"66a01e03-1e3b-4c36-8e49-edf9b9addcd9"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["9935"]},"execution_count":12,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["len(train_features)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":137},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":203,"status":"ok","timestamp":1716718051238,"user":{"displayName":"Jasper Bruin","userId":"13767118553284273610"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"FHml9DUHn_bh","outputId":"22261f72-a3a4-4b89-dfc9-9551fba9ae7b"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'[Claim]:In her budget speech, Nirmala Sitharaman claimed that the Government distributed 35,000 crore LED bulbs in the country.[Evidences]:Did Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman claim the government distributed 35,000 crore LED bulbs under the Ujala scheme?

The photo shows Sitharaman delivering her budget speech while a caption at the bottom reads - \"35,000 crore LED bulb baantein gaye\" (35,000 crore LED bulbs were distributed). The snapshot gives the impression that Sitharaman said this sentence in her speech. Netizens are displaying shock at this whopping number believing that the finance minister\\'s statement is true. Some Congress leaders are also trolling her by sharing the screenshot of the news channel. But, India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that Sitharaman never said that 35,000 crore LED bulbs were distributed in the country in her speech. In fact, she said that approximately 35 crore LED bulbs were distributed under the Ujala scheme. Among many who have shared the news channel\\'s screenshot is Congress spokesperson Shobha Oza who tweeted the picture. Her tweet was retweeted more than 350 times and had over 1,500 likes by the time of writing this story. Former Cabinet Minister in Haryana government, Mahender Pratap Singh also trolled Sitharaman, believing the news to be true.

That’s what an attack ad by the House Majority PACclaimed. \"He’s back. Dino Rossi,\" the voiceover in the ad says. \"Rossi first showed up in Olympia decades ago. He went to work! Health care stripped from 45,000 children.\" They’re referencing a 2003 budget measure, back when Rossi was the state Senate Ways and Means chairman. The budget was looking bleak, so Republicans proposed large spending cuts that year. One, proposed by Rossi, was a $50 million cut in Medicaid spending. The cut would have eliminated coverage for nearly 40,000 low-income children, according to reporting at the time. But the cut didn’t fly with Democrats, and ended up being scrapped in the final budget. The final budget, which won bipartisan support, wasn\\'t a specific cut, but it did include rules changes. Those changesultimately resulted in the loss of coverage for 45,000 kids on Medicaid. While it didn’t change any of the eligibility requirements, the budget changed state Medicaid policy in a way that lead to an enrollment decline later reported by state health care agencies. We were unable to trace this measure back to Rossi himself, but he did vote in its favor. First, it ended continuous eligibility, which meant if a family’s income was over the income standard, the child’s medical coverage would end. Second, certification periods went from every 12 to every six months. A signature became necessary for renewal, ending telephone renewals. Third, it adopted new income verification requirements; while it previously accepted a family’s statements, it now verified the information provided through available databases. \"These changes were requested by the legislature and they did have the impact of reducing the children’s caseload by at least 45,000,\" said Amy Blondin, chief communications officer for the Washington State Health Care Authority. Andrew Bell, spokesman for Dino Rossi, said the changes Rossi pushed forward in the budget ensured resources were given to the neediest families. \"So it seems like the HCA is saying that that was a combination of families who were making enough money to afford healthcare themselves moved off of Medicaid coverage, and a reduction in wealthy families who were cheating the system and taking health care from poorer families,\" Bell said. \"Either way, this seems to leave more resources available for truly needy families (which is the standard we\\'ve always used).\" That’s one way to interpret the drop. Using data from the Medical Assistance Administration, the University of Washington Health Policy Analysis Program found most children leaving Medicaid weren’t ineligible in an April 2004 study. \"In fact, only about 20 to 30 percent of the children removed are ineligible for Medicaid,\" the report read. \"Most are eligible but are inhibited from getting coverage because of the administrative barriers and hurdles described above.\" When the first two rules changed back (and income verification stay put) in 2005, the numbers mostly returned to normal. Source: The Commonwealth Fund, June 2006 \"I don’t think that ‘wealthy’ families were taking advantage of the program given the bounce back in enrollment,\" said Tricia Brooks, senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. The ad said Rossi stripped health care from 45,000 children. Rossi wasn’t solely responsible for the move, but he did support it. The 2003 Washington state Senate budget measure he voted for increased administrative hurdles for children seeking Medicaid coverage. Most of the eligible children regained coverage when the rules changed back in 2005.

Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, had a quick response, writing on Twitter: \".@POTUS no it’s not — in fact, your own administration published a study concluding 4/5 new cars on the road by 2050 will still require liquid fuels ... \"It’s past time Biden lives up to his promise to expand clean-burning #biofuels. Don’t mess with the RFS!\" Feenstra is correct about the share of cars in the United States projected to use liquid fuels. The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s 2021 Annual Energy Outlook report, which projects the nation’s environmental plans through 2050, says about 79% of new vehicle sales will be powered by liquid fuels — gasoline and blends that include up to 85% ethanol — in 2050. They accounted for 95% of sales in 2020, the report states. PolitiFact contacted Feenstra’s communications staff over 10 times for comment but did not receive a response. However, Feenstra’s tweet shared the link to his sourcing, and on page 15, the federal report notes that, while electric energy’s biggest demand growth area is transportation, the share will be small — less than 3%: \"Current laws and regulations are not projected to induce much market growth, despite continuing improvements in electric vehicles (EVs) through evolutionary market developments. Both vehicle sales and utilization (miles driven) would need to increase substantially for EVs to raise electric power demand growth rates by more than a fraction of a percentage point per year.\" And, on the report’s page 26: \"Because most light-duty vehicles have internal combustion engines, motor gasoline remains the major transportation fuel through 2050 as personal travel returns to pre-pandemic per-driver levels in the longer term.\" While 2050 is 29 years down the road, Biden did not state in Michigan a time limit on when he thinks electric power would come close to liquid fuels’ share of the automobile market. Nor did he state in detail what that future for electric power for automobiles would be. His administration’s Annual Energy Outlook reports that it is not predicting future energy use; rather it is a projection based on assumptions and methodologies that can be changed when subjected to changes in technology, demographics and resources. The report also notes that it is a response to the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977. That law requires the U.S. Energy Information Administration to produce annual reports on trends and projections for energy use and supply, the report notes. But Feenstra was precise with his facts, and is not alone reminding Biden to support biofuels. Other Iowa congressional members, Republican and Democrat, have pushed for biofuels support, regardless of who is president. So has the biofuels industry. The reason? Iowa leads the nation when it comes to producing biofuels from farm crops. It has capacity to produce 4.6 billion gallons, double the 2.3 billion in the No. 2 state, Nebraska. While we focused this story on predicted biofuels use in vehicles, it’s worth noting that Biden promised support for biofuels in a Sept. 9, 2020, campaign statement that criticized a pre-election policy reversal by then-President Donald Trump on biofuels. Trump’s reversal led to his administration’s rejection of oil refinery industry requests to be exempt from requirements to blend certain amounts of ethanol and biodiesel in gasoline: \"A Biden-Harris Administration will fight for family farmers and revitalize rural economies — from keeping our promises to farmers by ushering in a new era of biofuels, to investing in the broadband infrastructure and rural health care access that families and communities need,\" the Biden statement read. Trump reversed course again and approved on Jan. 19, 2021, just before leaving office, three biofuel waivers for refineries. Feenstra said the Biden Administration predicts that four out of five new cars on the road will require liquid fuels in 2050 and he cites the source. That source, a report from the Biden Administration, states that 79% of vehicles on the road will require liquid fuels by 2050.

A short video clip of Union Home Minister Amit Shah has gone viral with the claim that at a political rally, he said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi sleeps 24 hours for the welfare of the poor. Several Twitter and Facebook users shared this video clip with captions like, “Modi ji sleeps for 24 hours”. The India Today Anti-Fake News War Room ( AFWA) found the viral video was clipped and presented out of context to give it a different meaning. In the original video, Shah can be heard saying that PM Modi thinks about the welfare of the poor 24 hours a day while “Didi” (Mamta Banerjee) wonders when her nephew would become the Chief Minister. Shah made the statement while addressing a public meeting in Chapra, West Bengal, in April 2021. The viral posts are archived here, here, and here. AFWA probe With the help of keywords searches, we discovered that the same video along with the same claim had made the rounds of social media in 2021 as well. We found the original video on the official Bharatiya Janata Party YouTube channel. It was uploaded on April 17, 2021. The title of the YouTube video read, “HM Shri Amit Shah addresses public meeting in Chapra, West Bengal.” At the 5.34-minutes mark, one can hear the unedited version of the portion of the speech that went viral. In the original video, Shah was talking about the Trinamool Congress-led government in West Bengal. Shah said “This is a government for the welfare of the nephew... Modi ji thinks about the welfare of the poor, 24 hours a day. And Didi thinks about when her nephew will become Chief Minister, 24 hours a day.” Instead of “sote” (sleep), Shah said “sochte” (thinks) in the original video. But the video was clipped to change the meaning of the sentence altogether. Thus, an old clipped video of Amit Shah has gone viral with a misleading claim. (With inputs from Sanjana Saxena) INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Amit Shah said Narendra Modi sleeps for 24 hours for the welfare of the poor. Conclusion The viral video is clipped. In the original video, Shah says PM Modi thinks about the welfare of the poor, 24 hours a day, while “Didi” (Mamata Bannerjee) wonders when her nephew would become CM. Shah was addressing a public meeting in Chapra, West Bengal, in April 2021.
